# Diabetic Prediction using ML

## Overview
This project is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients using a Machine Learning (ML) model. The application accepts patient data, processes it through a trained logistic regression model, and provides a prediction along with AI-generated personalized health recommendations.

## Features
- **Diabetes Risk Prediction:** Uses a trained ML model to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on key health metrics.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Integrates Hugging Face's API via OpenAI client to generate personalized diet, exercise, and lifestyle advice.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Flask, providing an intuitive web interface for input and displaying results.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression model trained on diabetes dataset.
- **Hugging Face:** Utilizes Hugging Face API via OpenAI client for AI recommendations.
- **Flask:** Python web framework for building the app.
- **Pandas:** Data processing and manipulation.
- **Markdown:** Formatting AI-generated recommendations in the UI.
